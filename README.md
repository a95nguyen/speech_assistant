# speech_assistant
a simple speech assistant (no where close to Alexa unfortunately!) built with Python 3, the speech recognition library, and Google's text-to-speech API. <br>
includes responses to simple statements like "find location" and "search."

## next steps:
add a variety of possibilities for questions & responses: "what's the weather today?" or maybe a feature to open a desktop app through speech!
